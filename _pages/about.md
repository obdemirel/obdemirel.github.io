I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. My research interests include signal and image processing, optimization, and image reconstruction to address accelerated imaging and robust reconstruction techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. 

I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota in May 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Mehmet Akçakaya](https://imagine.umn.edu/people/mehmet-ak%C3%A7akaya). Previously, I received my masters degree in electrical engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. [Emine Ülkü Sarıtaş](https://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~saritas/). My master's research focused on Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) and magnetostimulation limits on human body. I obtained my bachelors degree in electrical engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey in 2015.
